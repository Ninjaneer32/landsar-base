THIS IS VERY OUT OF DATE - Leaving for the moment, but should delete

================================
THE CURRENT STATE OF WEB FINDER
================================


The intern who did the client side development of Web Finder left on Friday, August 23, 2019.
This is his note to any individuals who inherit his work and have to update the Web Finder files.


CURRENT PROBLEMS / NECESSARY FIXES
===================================

Web Finder was developed by this intern in two and half weeks. It is very likely there are
plenty of things broken. Here are a couple of known issues:
	- KMZs aren't always deleted on shutdown. If this is the case, they will still be returned
			by the server. Sometimes these are empty. If this is the case, currently Web Finder
			will load to check the KMZ and if it empty, stop loading, but not display anything
			to the user about why this did not work.
	- The Isolated Person Parameters are not being sent to the server. This is because the
			the server wanted the highest long possible for the "maxiumum duration". In java,
			this is possible to do. In JavaScript, a variable cannot store a number so high.
			The fastest fix for this problem was to just not send this data.
			

MISSING WEB FINDER FEATURES
===================================

Web Finder does not include any of the below features, but would nice additions. These include:
	- The ability to receive Web Sockets messages from the server
	- Spinning icon when the server is processing data, but not returned anything
	- Selecting a LPI
	- Preventing the user from creating a search when there is no LPI selected (see above)
	- Sending search data to server
	- Toggling Layers
	- Deletion of map items that does not include using a function in the code or
			using the browser console. The functionality to do so exists, but has not been implemented.
	- Setting an ip address and port (this might not actually be necessary)
	- Toggling Layers
	- Storing additional information using IndexedDB
	- Actually populate the View LPIs table with LPIs (It is currently blank because of time constraints)
	

PLUGIN AND LIBRARIES USED
===================================

Web Finder uses a variety of plugins in order to run. Some of these plugins include:
	- Leaflet (used for map creation and drawing of shapes not created by the user)
	- Leaflet.Draw (used to draw shapes created by the user)
	- Leaflet.Dialog (used to create the "menus" and forms that guide you through the
			steps of OSPPRE. This also includes the slider.)
	- Bootstrap (styling)
	- Font-awesome (includes icons used by Leaflet.Dialog)
	- JQuery
